There are 4 main resources in the directory API:
- Users
- Companies
- Networks
- Applications

## Connect to the Relaymark API

Our API is only accessible using the [OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) protocol 
using the [authorization code flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-24).

To make the connection you will need to provide the following informations:
| Name              | Type              | Description                    |
|:----------------- |:----------------- |:------------------------------ |
| baseUrl           | Uri               | The base Url of your application. |
| clientId          | String            | The id of the client registered within our API. |
| clientSecret      | String            | The secret of the client registered within our API. |
| scope             | Array of Strings  | The list of scopes your client wants to access (a scope is an identifier to a particular type of resource within our API). |
| redirectUri       | String            | This Uri will be called once the authorization process is finished. |
| logoutRedirectUri | String (optional) | This Uri will be called once the user is succesfully disconnected. |

The scopes available for your application are:
- offline_access (required)
- openid
- email
- profile
- rm
- rm_directory

Here is an example of configuration using the [relaymark.oauth2](https://github.com/Relaymark/Relaymark.oauth2) github project :

```
angular
  .module('YourAwesomeApp', ['relaymark.oauth2'])
  .config(function(svOAuth2Provider, AppConstants, $httpProvider) {
      svOAuth2Provider.configure({
          baseUrl: "www.beta.relaymark.com",
          clientId: "MyApp_AuthorizationCode@FRAK123456789",
          clientSecret: "bf33511e-9d62-46a8-965c-2c1ac732e621",
          scope: ["offline_access", "openid", "email", "profile", "rm", "rm_directory"],
          redirectUri: "www.beta.relaymark.com"
      });
  );
```

### Register your application

To register your application within our API, you will have to our main site [http://beta.relaymark.com/](http://beta.relaymark.com/),
register yourself as a user, create a company and finally go the application interface.

All the informations needed to make the connection to our API will be given to you

## Annex

### Ids and short ids

Most objects returned by our Api has an id. 
Those ids are composed by the type of the object followed by a slash and a unique number.

At some point when you use the Api, you will be asked for the shortId of an object (mostly when there are ids in the url itself).
a short id is just the numerical part of the base id.

For example :
```
Id: 		companies/314
ShortId:	314
```

To save you the trouble of constantly convert an id into a short id every object in the Api 
that has an id also has a short id property defined.

### LocalizedString object

Some attributes in our resources will be displayed in our applications 
(those are mostly name or description attributes that describes what your resource is/can do).
Those attributes needs to be localized in order to be comprehend by the most people.

A localizedString object is a hash table which contains strings in different language as values, 
and the language code as keys.

> The keys of the localizedString object must follow the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) standard 
and be a 2 letter language code.

```
{
	"en": "My event type",
	"fr" : "Mon type d'événement"
}
```

### Paged requests

Most of the list calls in our API implement a paging system. 
You cannot list all objects of your query in one call. 
Instead You have to get pages of your query.

Each query implement the following query string attributes:

| Name          | Type                  | Description                    |
|:------------- |:--------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| page          | Integer (default: 1)  | The number of the requested page. |
| pageSize      | Integer (default: 20) | The size of the requested page. |

Also, those calls will always return a page list object:

```
{
	"totalResults": 366,
	"totalPages": 19,
	"page": 1,
	"results": [
		//... The objects your queried
	],
}
```
