<!-- /TOC -->

Relaymark Data Engine is a project that reconcile the complex organisational structure of retail networks
with the management and sharing of statistical data between the actors of these networks. 

The project has 3 main objectives:

- to be able to render counters of a specific retail store as graphs.
A counter is a flow of numerical values over time. For example, the number of visitors of a particular retail store over time.
- to provide a generic solution for the management of events.
An event can be anything that happens to a registered target at a precise date. 
For example, A customer "A" entered the retail store "B". Or, the retail store "B" opened.
- to be able to make complex queries over the client's database of Customers, Companies, Networks. 
The client is also able to extend the search engine by providing its own set of data via the dataChunk system.

The API is separated into 3 group:

- The declaration API, where you define the structure of the data you want to push.
- The populate API, dedicated to pushing and administrating the data.
- The consume API, dedicated to the consumption of the data you have access to.

> ## Disclaimer
>
> Relaymark Data engine is still in it's early phase of development and is not ready for comercial use yet.
>
> Some part of it (or all) may radically change as the development continues.

## Connect to the Relaymark API

### Request format

### Response format

## Declaration API

It is the part of the API where you define the structure of the data you want to push.

> ### Requirements
> 
> You need to be connected as a user to the relaymark API (using oauth2 [Authorization code grant type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749))
> and this user needs to be the manager of at least one company to be able to create a dataSource.

### DataSource

The DataSource represents the description of company's data flow. 
It describes what your company can provide for a particular target.

> A 'target' can be a customer, a company, a network, a location or a division present in the Relaymark Database.

A dataChunk is a set of data completing a targeted object.
For example you can add a dataChunk for the customer "A" specifiyng that its gender is "female", 
its favorite color is "blue" and last bought car model is "TESLA Model S".

A dataChunkType describes a particular set of dataChunks and holds its configuration.

## Consume API

This Api is dedicated to the consumption of the data you have access to. 

### Counters

A counter is a flow of numerical values over time. For example, the number of visitors of a particular retail store over time.

As a user, you have access to all the counters linked directly or indirectly to one of your company or network.

The counter objects returned by the different calls of the consume API 
is a compilation of the [counter](#registration) object defined in the populate API, and the [counterType](#counter-types) object defined in the declaration API.

The resulting JSON object contains the following attributes:

### Search

The Data Engine gives you the possibility to extend the data of some objects within 
the Relaymark API by attaching a [dataChunk](#datachunk) to it.

This section describes the API calls that enables you to query those extended objects.

#### Query

- Path: /data-engine/consume/{targetType}/search
- HTTP verb: GET
- Description: This method returns a list of augmented target objects.

The URL specify the following parameters:

| Name       | Type   | Description                    |
|:---------- |:------ |:------------------------------ |
| targetType | String | The object's type you want to query. It can be one of the following values: <ul><li>company</li><li>network</li><li>location</li><li>customer</li></ul> |

The query string accepts the following parameters:

| Name      | Type                  | Description                    |
|:--------- |:--------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| page      | Integer (default: 1)  | The number of the requested page (see [Paged requests](#paged-requests)). |
| pageSize  | Integer (default: 20) | The size of the requested page (see [Paged requests](#paged-requests)). |
| query     | String                | A ravenDb/lucene query to filter the results. |

> See the [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/3.0/csharp/indexes/querying/full-query-syntax) documentation 
> and the [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) documentation fo more information about the query syntax.

> You can get the description of all the returned object properties (and what you can query) by using the [Definition](#definition) call.

```
insert example request 
```

When the query is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and returns a [paged list](#paged-requests) of augmented target objects:

```
{
	"totalResults": 366,
	"totalPages": 19,
	"page": 1,
	"results": [
		//... The objects your queried
	],
} 
```

#### Definition

- Path: /data-engine/consume/{targetType}/search/definition
- HTTP verb: GET
- Description: This method returns a list of augmented target objects.

The URL specify the following parameters:

| Name       | Type   | Description                    |
|:---------- |:------ |:------------------------------ |
| targetType | String | The object's type you want to get the defenition from. It can be one of the following values: <ul><li>company</li><li>network</li><li>location</li><li>customer</li></ul> |

```
insert example request 
```

When the query is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and returns a JSON object describing all the properties of the targeted object type:

```
{
	"properties": [
		{
			"name": "Gender",
			"propertyType": "string"
		},
		{
			"name": "totalNumberOfVisits",
			"propertyType": "number"
		},
		{
			"name": "lastVisitDate",
			"propertyType": "date"
		},
	]
} 
```

## Annex

### Ids and short ids

Most objects returned by our Api has an id. 
Those ids are composed by the type of the object followed by a slash and a unique number.

At some point when you use the Api, you will be asked for the shortId of an object (mostly when there are ids in the url itself).
a short id is just the numerical part of the base id.

For example :
```
Id: 		companies/314
ShortId:	314
```

To save you the trouble of constantly convert an id into a short id every object in the Api 
that has an id also has a short id property defined.

### LocalizedString object

Some attributes in our resources will be displayed in our applications 
(those are mostly name or description attributes that describes what your resource is/can do).
Those attributes needs to be localized in order to be comprehend by the most people.

A localizedString object is a hash table which contains strings in different language as values, 
and the language code as keys.

> The keys of the localizedString object must follow the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) standard 
and be a 2 letter language code.

```
{
	"en": "My event type",
	"fr" : "Mon type d'événement"
}
```

### Paged requests

Most of the list calls in our API implement a paging system. 
You cannot list all objects of your query in one call. 
Instead You have to get pages of your query.

Each query implement the following query string attributes:

| Name          | Type                  | Description                    |
|:------------- |:--------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| page          | Integer (default: 1)  | The number of the requested page. |
| pageSize      | Integer (default: 20) | The size of the requested page. |

Also, those calls will always return a page list object:

```
{
	"totalResults": 366,
	"totalPages": 19,
	"page": 1,
	"results": [
		//... The objects your queried
	],
}
```
